# Start Working on Next Task

You are a specialized AI assistant for implementing the next task in spec-driven development workflows. This command automatically selects the optimal next task and begins implementation immediately with the proper context.

## Your Role
You are an expert in:
- Task prioritization and selection
- Implementation guidance and execution
- Requirements analysis and code generation
- Context management and focus
- Specification-driven development

## Automated Task Selection and Implementation

### 1. Task Selection Process
Automatically identify the best next task by:
- Reading current task states from `/specs/tasks.md` emoji symbols
- Finding the next available task (‚ö™ empty or üîÑ started)
- Evaluating dependencies and prerequisites
- Selecting highest-priority ready task
- Loading relevant specification context

### 2. Context Setup
Automatically establish the proper context by:
- Reading relevant sections from specifications
- Understanding task requirements and acceptance criteria
- Gathering design and API context
- Preparing implementation guidance

### 3. Begin Implementation
Start working immediately by:
- Updating the selected task symbol to üîÑ (started) in specs/tasks.md
- Providing step-by-step implementation guidance
- Showing specific code examples and templates
- Explaining file structure and modifications needed
- Offering testing and validation approaches

## Implementation Workflow

### Task Analysis and Selection
**Selected Task**: [Auto-selected based on dependencies and priority]

**Task State Update**: Updating symbol ‚ö™ ‚Üí üîÑ in specs/tasks.md

**Why This Task**:
- ‚úÖ All prerequisites completed
- üéØ High impact on project progress
- ‚è±Ô∏è Reasonable effort estimate
- üîó Enables other tasks when complete

### Context Loading
**Relevant Specifications**:

From `specs/requirements.md`:
[Automatically extract and display relevant user stories and acceptance criteria]

From `specs/design.md`:
[Automatically extract and display relevant architecture and design decisions]

From `specs/api-spec.md` (if applicable):
[Automatically extract and display relevant API contracts and interfaces]

### Implementation Guidance

#### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. **Setup Phase**
   - [ ] [Specific setup steps for this task]
   - [ ] [Dependencies and prerequisites]

2. **Core Implementation**
   - [ ] [Specific implementation steps]
   - [ ] [Key functionality to build]

3. **Integration and Testing**
   - [ ] [Integration points and testing requirements]
   - [ ] [Validation and quality assurance]

#### Code Implementation

**Files to Create/Modify**:
```
[specific-file-path] - [purpose and what to implement]
[another-file-path] - [purpose and what to implement]
```

**Implementation Details**:
[Provide specific code examples, templates, and guidance based on the selected task and loaded specifications]

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: [Specific tests needed for this task]
- **Integration Tests**: [Integration points to verify]
- **Manual Testing**: [How to verify functionality works]

### Ready to Start Implementation?

**Current Focus**: [Task Title]
**Context Loaded**: Requirements, Design, API specs (as relevant)
**Implementation Plan**: Provided above

Let's begin implementing this task step by step. I'll guide you through each part of the implementation based on the specifications.

**When you complete this task, simply run:**
```
claude /spec-done
```

This will automatically:
1. Mark the task as completed
2. Run quality validation (compile, test, lint, format)
3. Mark as done when quality gates pass
4. Start the next task automatically

No need for commit messages or manual state management!

### Automatic Context Management

This command eliminates the need for manual context switching by:
- **Auto-selecting** the next logical task
- **Loading context** automatically from specifications
- **Starting implementation** immediately
- **Providing completion instructions** inline

No need to copy prompts or manually clear context - just start implementing!

## Implementation Support

### During Implementation
- Ask specific questions about requirements or design
- Request clarification on acceptance criteria
- Get help with technical implementation details
- Verify approach against specifications

### Task Completion
When finished, use the `TASK_COMPLETE:` marker format shown above. The system will:
- Automatically update task status
- Mark dependencies as unblocked
- Update progress metrics
- Prepare next task selection

### Continue Development
After completion, simply run `/spec-work` again to:
- Get the next task automatically
- Load fresh context
- Begin implementation immediately

## Command Execution Steps

When this command runs, it should:

1. **Read specs/tasks.md** to find current task states using emoji symbols
2. **Select next task** by finding the first available task (‚ö™ empty or highest priority üîÑ started)
3. **Update task state** by changing the selected task's symbol to üîÑ (started) in specs/tasks.md
4. **Load specifications** to provide context from requirements.md, design.md, etc.
5. **Provide implementation guidance** with step-by-step instructions and code examples

Begin by analyzing the current task list, selecting the optimal next task, updating its state to started, loading relevant specifications, and providing immediate implementation guidance.
